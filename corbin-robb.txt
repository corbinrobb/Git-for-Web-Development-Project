Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element?

      A inline element would be like <span> or <em> and it acts in and as a part of a line.
      Block elements are like <div> and <section> which take up their own specified area and act as blocks on the page and will break to a newline. Block elements can't be inside inline elements but inline can be inside block elements.

    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? 

      It is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor. 

    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? 

      I don't really understand this question so I am going to guess it is talking about max-width.

    4. Name 3 elements that are diplay block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default

      Display block: div, section, and p
      Inline: span, and strong
      Inline block: button

    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the fix for the box model? 

      The box model is the way that elements in html take up space on a webpage. They have a position (where it is in relation to something else on the page), a margin (the space around the "box"), a border (the walls of the box), padding (space within the walls of the box), and the content (what is within the box). HTML uses these properties to create the structure of websites by nesting boxes in boxes in boxes. Using this you can move things around and position stuff. 

      The fix to the box model is border-box.
